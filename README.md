## Features

- **Multi-Task Learning**: Jointly train multiple perception tasks with uncertainty weighting
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for deployment on 5M+ vehicles worldwide
- **Production-Ready**: Includes distributed training, experiment tracking, and model export
- **Safety-First**: Comprehensive validation and testing framework
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for edge deployment on automotive hardware

## Tasks

1. **Semantic Segmentation**
   - Road, lane, vehicle, and pedestrian segmentation
   - High-precision pixel-level classification

2. **Object Detection**
   - Vehicle, pedestrian, and traffic light detection
   - Anchor-based detection with FPN

3. **Classification**
   - Stain/no-stain classification
   - Binary classification with uncertainty

4. **Depth Estimation**
   - Monocular depth estimation
   - Metric depth prediction

## Architecture

- **Backbone**: ResNet50 with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
- **Task Heads**: Specialized decoders for each task
- **Loss**: Multi-task loss with uncertainty weighting
- **Training**: Distributed training with mixed precision

### Multi-Task Loss Function

The model uses uncertainty weighting to automatically balance the losses from different tasks. For each task $t$, the loss is weighted by the inverse of the task's uncertainty $\sigma_t$:

$$
\mathcal{L}_t = \sum_{i=1}^{T} \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2} \mathcal{L}_i + \log \sigma_i
$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_t$ is the loss for task $t$
- $\sigma_t$ is the learnable uncertainty parameter for task $t$
- $T$ is the total number of tasks

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
